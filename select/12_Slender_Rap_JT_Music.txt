Okay, honestly
I dont know how much more that I can take
It feels like every time I move my sanity's about to break
For those who've never played
I don't suggest this game to you
If you want a therapist until your 92
Because I'm twitching
And shaking
And sweating of my ass
Now I'm super paranoid
WHAT WAS THAT!?
The cat
Wait a sec
Up ahead
Is that another note
Yes, yes!
Thank God!
Now I think I'm getting close
Dammit!
That was just my first
Now it's time to find the next
Tonight I'm gunna check inside my closet 'fore I got to bed
Not because I'm scared just to make sure my clothes are there
Yeah not for slender man
HA! I dont even care
Now the music's picking up
And my light is getting dim
And I hear the static buzz
The screen is fuzzy
AH! THATS HIM!
And somehow
I dont know
I just lost
All control
My bowel movement had a mind of it's own
(Mind of it's own)
Thanks to you
Slender man
I need to
Change my pants
Wow what the hell even happened in here
I swear I dont know!
I admit that was a fluke
But that will not be the end!
I will kill you if you puke and dook on the floor again
So I shut my door
Lights off
Volume full blast
And I think I'll be prepared with this cork inside my ass
Slendy, Slendy
Where are you now?
I'm just minding my own business
You dont have to sneak around
Oh my God! theres a fence
Oh my God! another fence!
Okay a truck,
A tunnel,
A rock --
ANOTHER FENCE!
Dude I'm just a little kid
Slender man why you creeping
Wheres Chris Hanson from date line when you freaking need him?!
I'm not scared anymore
Slender isnt even real
I'll go on my merry way
OH JESUS TAKE THE WHEEL!
I thought this
Cork would work
But somehow
Things got worse!
Think I puked up twice as much had come out my rear (come out my rear)
Slender man
What the hell?!
Cant get rid
Of the smell
*Knock knock*
Skull what's going on?
Do not come in here!
Now I'm trapped in my room
Puke and dookies on the floor
Somehow I still have the notes
And I only need one more
Holy farts! This is intense
Hes teleporting everywhere
Ah!
Wah!
Gah!
Ugh!
Change directions and he's there!
Oh no not the pool house
God why the pool house?!
Haven't been inside it yet
And there is no way out!
But I need the note
I need to win I'm so close!
Oh my God! He's right behind me
Time to book it here we go
Duke left!
Duke right!
And the music's getting louder
And the screen is getting fuzzy
And my light is losing power
Hope's he's not around the corner
Cuz my life depends on this
Empty chair over there?!
Wheres the note there it is!
Fml!
Should have known
That this game
Was a troll!
It dont matter what you do
Because he will find you! (because he will find you)
Thanks a lot
This game sucks!
Now I just
Need a hug
From someone with a face
Thanks very much!
