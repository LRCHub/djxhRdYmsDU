Love and hope and sex and dreams
Pride and joy, fast cars, ice cream
Jet black hair, soft socks and shoes
Let's fish around, free air again

Golden madness, feed off dead meat
Time not lost but sold white teeth
We want victory, we want truth
A million stars move into view

Slender fungus was a disc of shiny concrete
Slender fungus was a disc, a shiny ball of meat
Slender fungus sucks the toes that linger 'round your feet
Slender fungus eats in bed before he goes to sleep

Feeling good here in the rain
Worms dancing, dancing in your veins
I am you but you're not me
Bitter dolls, these always free

Dance 'til it hurts in a midnight glow
Truth is simple, can't ever say no
Flames fly higher, look up the moon
Watching demons again, neither are you

Slender fungus was a disc of shiny concrete
Slender fungus was a disc, a shiny ball of meat
Slender fungus kissed a fish inside a stolen jeep
Slender fungus eats

But we play all the things you are
Bomb song, swan song, red hot jazz
Burn ourselves out, just to please
Back to a car, get on your knees

Big, big bomb song, gets burnt out
Light your fire, move into view
You can do better, you can do better
You can do better, that's only true

Slender fungus was a disc of shiny concrete
Slender fungus was a disc, a shiny ball of meat
Slender fungus sucks the toes that linger 'round your feet
Slender fungus eats in bed before he goes to sleep
