The car wheels hummed and the radio whined
The rise and fall of telephone lines
I was trying to remember the last thing you said
Holding on to the slender thread

I was awakened last night by the knife of a moon
I've been spooling out a thread from my heart to you
Don't give up on me whatever you do
I'm holding on to the slender thread

So look up and bless every guiding star
We've worked so hard and come so far
And home is still wherever you are
Holding on to the slender thread

I never knew it would come to this
That world I knew would no longer exist
I can still feel it burn like a place you kissed
Holding on to the slender thread

So look up and bless every guiding star
We've worked so hard and come so far
And home is still wherever you are
Holding on to the slender thread

Scams and scriptures posted by the roadside
Whole stories hung out on loose on the clotheslines
I've left a trail of crumbs and a paper map
As the miles unravel it's love that calls me back

I used to lay out altars in hotel rooms
On cigarette burnt tables and check out at noon
A stone and a feather and a letter from you
Holding on to the slender thread

So look up and bless every guiding star
We've worked so hard and come so far
And home is still wherever you are

So look up and bless every guiding star
We've worked so hard and come so far
And home is still wherever you are
Holding on to the slender thread
